四种工作负载的压力图
说明压力在工作过程中并不均匀

```c
DEFINE_double(a_qps,100.0,"qps");
DEFINE_int32(a_bs,128,"bs");
DEFINE_double(a_rw,0.5,"rw");

DEFINE_double(b_qps,200.0,"qps");
DEFINE_int32(b_bs,128 ,"bs");
DEFINE_double(b_rw,0.5,"rw");

DEFINE_double(c_qps,300.0,"qps");
DEFINE_int32(c_bs,64 ,"bs");
DEFINE_double(c_rw,0.5,"rw");

DEFINE_double(d_qps,400.0,"qps");
DEFINE_int32(d_bs,128 ,"bs");
DEFINE_double(d_rw,0.5,"rw");

==========================================

DEFINE_double(a_qps,800.0,"qps");
DEFINE_int32(a_bs,128,"bs");
DEFINE_double(a_rw,0.5,"rw");

DEFINE_double(b_qps,800.0,"qps");
DEFINE_int32(b_bs,128 ,"bs");
DEFINE_double(b_rw,0.5,"rw");

DEFINE_double(c_qps,800.0,"qps");
DEFINE_int32(c_bs,128 ,"bs");
DEFINE_double(c_rw,0.5,"rw");

DEFINE_double(d_qps,800.0,"qps");
DEFINE_int32(d_bs,128 ,"bs");
DEFINE_double(d_rw,0.5,"rw");

那个设置为2  这个很关键但是别忘了改回来啊
